## Service Information
- **Port:** 8081
- **Purpose:** Service discovery, health monitoring, and distributed coordination
- **Independence:** Fully independent service with own database and dependencies

## Current Quality Status

### Summary
- **Grade:** C (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)
- **Critical Errors:** 0 ✅
- **Warnings:** 39 ⚠️
- **Status:** Stable but needs improvement

### Issues by Category

#### Code Quality (10 issues)
- Line length violations (E501): 13 occurrences
- Blank lines with whitespace (W293): 1 occurrence
- Function call in argument defaults (B008): Multiple in routes

#### Type Checking (9 issues)
- Missing type annotations
- Incompatible types in some functions
- Need to add proper type hints

#### Import Structure (19 potential issues)
- Some circular import risks
- Can be refactored for cleaner structure

#### Dependencies (39 outdated)
- Multiple packages need updating
- Security updates available

## How to Fix

### Quick Fixes (Automated)
```bash
# Fix formatting and basic issues
make quality-fix

# Format code
make format

# Run linting
make lint
```

### Manual Fixes Required
1. **Type annotations:** Add missing type hints to functions
2. **Line length:** Break long lines manually where auto-fix can't
3. **Import structure:** Refactor to avoid circular dependencies
4. **Dependencies:** Update packages carefully with testing

## Quality Commands

This service has its own quality management:

```bash
# Check quality status
make quality-check

# Auto-fix what's possible
make quality-fix

# Generate detailed report
make quality-report

# Run all checks
make check
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Short Term (This Sprint)
- [ ] Fix all ruff warnings
- [ ] Add missing type annotations
- [ ] Update critical dependencies

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Refactor import structure
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 80%
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Implement full OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create service-specific dashboards

## Service Independence

This service maintains complete independence:
- ✅ Own quality-check.sh script
- ✅ Own Makefile with quality commands
- ✅ Own pyproject.toml configuration
- ✅ Own test suite
- ✅ Own dependencies (requirements.txt)
- ✅ Own database (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ No shared libraries with other services

## Next Steps

1. Run `make quality-fix` to auto-fix issues
2. Manually fix remaining type annotations
3. Update dependencies with `pip install --upgrade`
4. Re-run `make quality-check` to verify improvements
