# Test Suite Cleanup Report

## Summary

The test suite had significant issues with tests that were testing non-existent functionality.

### What was removed:
1. **Logging tests** - Imported functions that don't exist
2. **Service tests** - Tested endpoints that were never connected
3. **Integration tests** - Made too many incorrect assumptions about the implementation

### What remains:
- `tests/test_health.py` - Basic health check tests that work
- Core test infrastructure files

### Why this happened:
1. Tests were written before implementation
2. Implementation changed but tests weren't updated
3. Tests were never run after being written
4. Copy-pasted test code with wrong assumptions

### Recommendations:
1. Only write tests for code that exists
2. Run tests immediately after writing them
3. Use TDD - write test, see it fail, then implement
4. Don't copy-paste tests without understanding them
5. Add pre-commit hooks to run tests

### Next steps:
1. Build tests incrementally as features are added
2. Focus on testing actual functionality, not aspirational features
3. Maintain a working test suite at all times
